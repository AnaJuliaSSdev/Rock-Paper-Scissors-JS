# Rock-Paper-Scissors-JS
Rock Paper Scissors project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

This project was carried out for educational purposes, and therefore, I found it interesting to bring some notes that I made about the commands used in the JavaScript code.
This notes are available in the code comments.
